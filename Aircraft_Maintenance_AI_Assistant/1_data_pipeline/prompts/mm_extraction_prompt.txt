Your task is to extract specific sections from a series of images that represent pages from a Maintenance Memo for an Aircraft.

The expected output is a dictionary, where each key represents a section.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Iterate through each image provided.
2. Use the following <scratchpad> to extract sections from each image:

<scratchpad>
For the current image:
- Look for Memo No on the top right corner of first page and extract it into "Memo No" key value pair
- Extract "AIRCRAFT MODEL" and the text beside as key value pair
- Extract "AIRCRAFT EFFECTIVITY" and the text beside it as key value pair
- Extract "SUBJECT" and the text below it as key value pair
- Extract "DISCUSSION" and the text below it as key value pair
- Extract "ACTION" and the text below it as key value pair
- Extract "COMPLIANCE" and any text below until next section starts as key value pair
- Extract "REASON FOR REVISION", "REFERENCE" and the text corresponding to those sections as key value pairs
</scratchpad>

Once all images have been processed, format the complete data into a dictionary with keys for each section, returning them as a dictionary.

<output>
[
{Dictionary}
]
</output>

Note: 1. Do not modify the text present in the images
2. If the text is spanning across images, make sure extract everything in the same order as it was present including the subsections and sections
3. Do not add any extra text outside of the Dictionary list
